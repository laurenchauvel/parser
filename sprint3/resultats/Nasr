Abstract : ['Abstract\nMACAON is a tool suite for standard NLP tasks\ndeveloped for French. MACAON has been de-\nsigned to process both human-produced text\nand highly ambiguous word-lattices produced\nby NLP tools. MACAON is made of several na-\ntive modules for common tasks such as a tok-\nenization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntac-\ntic parsing, all communicating with each other\nthrough XML ﬁles . In addition, exchange pro-\ntocols with external tools are easily deﬁnable.\nMACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, dis-\ntributed under GNU Public License.', 4]
