Abstract : ['We present a cut and paste based text summa- \nrizer, which uses operations derived from an anal- \nysis of human written abstracts. \nThe summarizer \nedits extracted sentences, using reduction to remove \ninessential phrases and combination to merge re- \nsuiting phrases together as coherent sentences. Our \nwork includes a statistically based sentence decom- \nposition program that identifies where the phrases of \na summary originate in the original document, pro- \nducing an aligned corpus of summaries and articles \nwhich we used to develop the summarizer.', 7]
