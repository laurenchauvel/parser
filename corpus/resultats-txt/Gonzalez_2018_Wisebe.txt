Abstract : . Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) has been a major
research topic since Automatic Speech Recognition transcripts have been
used for further Natural Language Processing tasks like Part of Speech
Tagging, Question Answering or Automatic Summarization. But what
about evaluation? Do standard evaluation metrics like precision, recall,
F-score or classiﬁcation error; and more important, evaluating an auto-
matic system against a unique reference is enough to conclude how well
a SBD system is performing given the ﬁnal application of the transcript?
In this paper we propose Window-based Sentence Boundary Evaluation
(WiSeBE), a semi-supervised metric for evaluating Sentence Boundary
Detection systems based on multi-reference (dis)agreement. We evalu-
ate and compare the performance of diﬀerent SBD systems over a set
of Youtube transcripts using WiSeBE and standard metrics. This dou-
ble evaluation gives an understanding of how WiSeBE is a more reliable
metric for the SBD task.
